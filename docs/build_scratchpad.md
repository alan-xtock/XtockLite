Component Description: Testimonial Section
This is a clean, minimalist testimonial section designed to highlight customer impact. It's built in three parts: a main header, a sub-header, and a grid of testimonials.

1. Main Header
Text: "Real stories. Real impact."

Font: Large, bold, sans-serif.

Style: The words "Real impact." are emphasized with a hand-drawn, thick green circle, giving it an organic, highlighted feel.

2. Sub-header
Text: "Trusted by chefs, managers, and operators across the hospitality industry â€” here's what they have to say."

Font: Standard sans-serif, regular weight, and much smaller than the main header. It acts as a brief introduction.

3. Testimonial Grid
Layout: A two-column grid of four testimonials. (This would likely stack into a single column on mobile).

Individual Testimonial Style:

Border: Each testimonial has a thin, vertical, light green line on its left side, visually separating it.

Quote: The main text is in a black, sans-serif font. Key phrases that emphasize positive outcomes (e.g., "fast", "by 62%", "simple and intuitive", "reduced our food waste by 35%") are bolded to draw the user's eye.

Attribution: Below the quote, the customer's name and role (e.g., "Derk, Head Chef") are written in a smaller, light green font.
